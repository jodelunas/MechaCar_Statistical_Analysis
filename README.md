* When reviewed as a whole, variance is within 100 psi, as set by company policy.

* When reviewed by individual lots, lots one and two are well within the acceptable variance. Lot 3 is well out of range with a variance of 170+; thus the single greatest contributor to negative drag on overall performance.
 
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

* Overall T-test results for the suspension coils across all manufacturing plants show they are not statistically different from the population mean, and the p-value is not low enough to reject the null hypothesis.

* Lot 1 has performed strongest of the three locations. With a p-value of one, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

* Lot 2 has preformed well and the p-value is not low enough to reject the null hypothesis.

* Lot 3 has not met company standard tolerance in manufacturing this part. The p-value is below .05, so we must reject the null hypothesis.
